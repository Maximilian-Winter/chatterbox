# Coding Guidelines

1. Before writing any code, create a detailed development plan of the feature you want to implement, using the `codebase-analyzer-planner` agent.
2. When creating or changing individual files, use the `code-change-planner` to plan the changes.
2. After finishing the writing or changing a file, write a small test script for important functionality.
